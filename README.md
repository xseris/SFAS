# SFAS

This page is for sharing a free book about boring stuff. This book is supposed to be a collection of history facts, riddles, challenges and their solutions. It will follow the following pseudo rule: described histories and facts are pseudo real, described techniques are pseudo documented, proofs are pseudo mathematical or follows some pseudo logical path, challenges and riddles are pseudo unique and pseudo error free and, finally, solutions are pseudo correct.

The book is not complete yet and never will be. That is why it is free and available for all. Time will increase the number of contents in the book, adding sections, paragraphs and new chapters, according also to your suggestions on the issues page. In this page (https://github.com/xseris/SFAS/issues)

Writing a book usually involves in consuming time and almost all knows that time is money. So if you like the knowledge inside the book just consider subscribing here: https://www.patreon.com/xseris, otherwise just enjoy the reading. Contributors names will be added at the end of the book.
